    <h2>Actions</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>actions</b> panel summarizes the list of actions that the user decided to apply after the comparison to streamline the deployment phase.<br/>
        Actions are displayed (and applied) in the same order as they are defined.
    </p>
    <p>User can choose to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Clear the action list</b>: all the actions are removed from the action list.</li>
        <li><b>Remove a specific action from the list</b>: removes the selected action from the list.</li>
        <li><b>Apply all the actions</b>: all the actions are applied in the same order they are defined.</li>
        <li><b>Apply only the "checked" actions</b>: all the actions that are checked in the list are applied, in the same order they are defined.</li>
        <li><b>Select all the actions</b>: all the actions are automatically checked.</li>
        <li><b>Deselect all the actions</b>: all the checks on the actions are automatically removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A confirmation prompt is displayed to the user before executing any specific operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an action fails, a log is tracked in the <b><a href="/output">Output view</a></b>, and the system moves forward with the next one.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the actions that have successfully been applied are automatically removed from the list.<br/>
        At the end of the process, a new comparison is triggered in order to display the results of the applied actions.
