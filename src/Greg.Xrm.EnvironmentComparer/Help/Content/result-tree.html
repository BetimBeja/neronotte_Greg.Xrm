    <h2>Result summary</h2>
    <p>The <b>Result Summary view</b> is automatically filled and displayed when a comparison process completes.</p>
    <p>A treeview is displayed showing <b>a node for each compared entity</b>, with 4 subnodes, each one corrisponding to one of the 4 possible cluster of results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Matching</b>: represents a record that is present in both environments, with matching fields. During a deploy, there is nothing to do with such kind of records.</li>
        <li><b>Missing on ENV1</b>: represents a record that is present in ENV2 but not in ENV1. During a deploy, probably it should be removed.</li>
        <li><b>Missing on ENV2</b>: represents a record that is present in ENV1 but not in ENV2. During a deploy, probably it shoud be added to ENV2.</li>
        <li><b>With differences</b>: represents a record that is present in both environments, but has differences in one or more fields.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For each entity, the total number of analyzed records is displayed after the entity name.<br />
        In the subnodes, the total number of records of the cluster is displayed after the cluster name, compared with the total number of records in all clusters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Text color is used to improve the readability of the results:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Green</b> is used to identify having all matching records. Those nodes are by default displayed without additional info.</li>
        <li><b>Dark gray</b> is used to identify empty clusters.</li>
        <li><b>Light gray</b> is used to identify clusters containing at least one record.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Comparison results can be also <b>exported in Excel</b> for further analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>Available actions on result clusters</h3>
    <p>
        Right-clicking on a node of the <b>Result summary tree view</b>, a context menu shows the list of possible actions
        that can be applied to the records related to the selected node. <br />
        Actions are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mark as good</b>: Clears the current entity as "good" (green) even if it has differences.</li>
        <li><b>Unmark as good</b>: Restores the node status.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Right-clicking on a subnode of the <b>Result summary tree view</b>, a context menu shows the list of possible actions
        that can be applied to the records related to the selected node. <br />
        Actions are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Copy to ENV2</b>: aligns both environments to the values of ENV1. Applicable only on <b>Missing on ENV2</b> or <b>With differences</b> subnodes.</li>
        <li><b>Copy to ENV1</b>: aligns both environments to the values of ENV2. Applicable only on <b>Missing on ENV1</b> or <b>With differences</b> subnodes.</li>
        <li><b>Delete from ENV1</b>: deletes the record from ENV1. Applicable only on <b>Missing on ENV2</b> or <b>With differences</b> subnodes.</li>
        <li><b>Delete from ENV2</b>: deletes the record from ENV2. Applicable only on <b>Missing on ENV1</b> or <b>With differences</b> subnodes.</li>
    </ul>
